		<p>üëã Hi! My name is Emily and I'll be reviewing my favorite bubble tea drinks from my top nine 
			favorite bubble tea stores in Ann Arbor and my six favorite bubble tea stores in New York City.</p><br>
		<p>With the many bubble or boba tea shops around the world, which ones are the best ones?</p><br>
		<p>If you wanna know my overall favorite bubble tea shop, check out my <a href = "aboutme.html">About Page</a>
			I will list out my overall favorite bubble tea store in Ann Arbor, New York City, and overall favorite store between the two.<br></p><br>
		<p class = "advisory">*Please be advised that all of this solely based on opinion. Everyone has their own liking.*</p><br>

		<p>So you might be wondering what was it about bubble milk tea that made me want to make this website.</p><br>
		<p>Well, the reason is because I wanted to shared to other people about my favorite bubble milk tea drinks, but also promote my Asian culture. I wanted other people who have never heard of bubble tea to try it out with the recommendations I made, meaning my top favorites 
			drink from each store I have tried. I hope to spread one important aspect of Asian culture that is not limited to only one country.</p><br>
			<p>The source of all bubbles teas it would seem, at Chun Shui Tang teahouse in Taichung, Taiwan. 
			The founder, Liu Han-Chieh, first came up with the idea of serving Chinese tea cold in the early 1980s after visiting Japan where he saw coffee served cold. Then, in 1988, his product development manager, Ms. Lin Hsiu Hui, 
			was sitting in a staff meeting and had brought with her a typical Taiwanese dessert called fen yuan, a sweetened tapioca pudding. Just for fun she poured the tapioca balls into her Assam iced tea and drank it. This was how bubble milk tea came about.</p><br>
			<div class = "home_emily">
				<img src = "img/me2.jpg" alt="Emily with Ding Tea in Ann Arbor">
			</div>
			<p>Most bubble milk tea chains originated from Taiwan, but bubble milk tea is part of a lot of Asian cultures. 
			In Asian cultures, tea is a big part of our tradition. We drink tea when we are eating out with families and friends or when giving our offerings to our elderlies or ancestors.
			I am one of the people who are deeply in love with bubble milk tea. As long as I have a variety of flavor of milk tea, I can drink them every day. For health reasons and my hope to live a long life, I limit myself from drinking too much milk teas, 
			especially those that have bobas in them. I will either limit myself or if I really want milk tea, I will opt out the bobas. The bobas aren't harmful when eaten moderately, but if too much of them are in the human system, the body won't react well to it.

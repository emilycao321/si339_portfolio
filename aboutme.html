			<p>Hello! It's Emily again.</p><br>

			<p>Just some background information.</p><br>
			<p>I am a junior at the <a class = "aboutme_umich" href = "https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> studying Information with a 
			focus in UX Design and Art & Design with a focus in Visual Communications Design. I am from the big Apple and I enjoy trying new food around New York City, but also in Ann Arbor when I am in town for college.

			<p>When I am not designing, I enjoy traveling and going for boba runs. Hence the reason why I created this website. I have been to so many
			bubble tea stores that I can taste the difference of the same bubble tea drink order between the stores. Bubble tea runs are a great 
			activity to do with my friends. When we want to do something small, we always go to one of our favorite bubble tea stores. I try to drink
			different drinks every time I go my usual store, so I can try something new.</p><br>
			<div class="city-image">

			<p>Bubble tea are a great way for people to try out something new. There's always new flavor, epecially during special holidays or a specific season.
				One chain that I feel is very experimental and gives a lot of flavor to their consumer is <span class = "bubbletea_store_quickly">Quickly</span>. There are always new flavors that I want to try.
				A store that I find to be very creative is  <span class = "bubbletea_store_yaya">Yaya</span>. They always have the coolest name for their drinks. One drink that I found very unqiue is "Scarlet Knight". 
				The name sounds so dreamy, yet so fierce. There's a lot of creativity in it. Not to mention, <span class = "bubbletea_store_yaya">Yaya</span> likes to tape a inspirational/motivational message on the bottom 
				of their cups. That is always something I look forward to looking at whenever I buy a drink at the place.
